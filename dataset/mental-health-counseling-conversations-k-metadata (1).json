Health Counseling Conversations","url":"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/melissamonfared/mental-health-counseling-conversations-k/versions/2","description":"### Context:\nThis dataset is a curated collection of questions and answers sourced from two prominent online counseling and therapy platforms. The questions span a wide range of mental health topics, including anxiety, depression, relationship issues, stress management, and more. The answers are provided by qualified and experienced psychologists, ensuring the responses are accurate and reliable. The primary purpose of this dataset is to facilitate the fine-tuning of language models, enhancing their capability to generate appropriate and helpful advice in response to mental health-related queries.\n\nThis dataset is a valuable resource for anyone looking to advance the field of AI-driven mental health support. By leveraging the real-world data it provides, developers and researchers can create more empathetic, accurate, and effective tools to assist individuals dealing with mental health challenges.\n\n### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards:\nThe dataset is designed to support the following tasks:\n- **Text Generation:** Particularly focused on generating advice or suggestions in response to mental health-related questions.\n- **Natural Language Understanding:** Enhancing AI models to understand the context of mental health discussions.\n- **Conversational AI:** Developing AI models capable of engaging in empathetic and informative mental health conversations.\n\n### Languages:\n- **Language:** English\n- The entire dataset is composed of text data in the English language, making it suitable for training and testing English language models.\n\n#### Data Instances: \nEach data instance in the dataset consists of the following fields:\n- **Context (string):** This field contains the question asked by a user. It represents the mental health-related query that requires a response. (The user\u0027s question, covering various mental health topics.)\n- **Response (string):** This field contains the corresponding answer provided by a psychologist. The response is a professional and well-considered piece of advice or guidance. (The psychologist\u0027s answer, providing advice, guidance, or information related to the user\u0027s query.)\n\n#### Curation Rationale:\nThe dataset was curated with the specific goal of aiding in the development of AI models that can effectively provide mental health advice or guidance. Given the sensitive nature of mental health, the dataset was meticulously cleaned to ensure that only the conversations relevant to mental health topics were included. This ensures the quality and focus of the dataset on the intended use case.\n\n#### Source Data:\n- **Raw Data Access:** The original, raw data can be accessed https://github.com/nbertagnolli/counsel-chat/tree/master/data \n  \n#### Personal and Sensitive Information:\n- **Sensitive Content:** The dataset may contain sensitive information related to mental health. All data has been anonymized to remove any personally identifiable information (PII), ensuring that the privacy of individuals is respected.\n\n### Dataset Details and Key Features:\n\n#### Key Features\n- **Real-world Conversations:** The dataset contains real questions and answers from online counseling platforms, making it highly relevant for training models in real-world scenarios.\n- **Diverse Topics:** The questions cover a wide array of mental health issues, providing a rich resource for training models on various aspects of mental wellness.\n- **Expert Responses:** All answers are provided by qualified psychologists, ensuring the responses are accurate and appropriate for mental health advice.\n\n#### Usage:\nThis dataset is highly versatile and can be used in various applications:\n- **Fine-tuning Language Models:** The dataset is ideal for fine-tuning models like GPT, BERT, or other transformer-based architectures to improve their performance in generating mental health advice.\n- **Conversational Agents:** Develop chatbots or virtual assistants that can provide basic mental health support or direct users to appropriate resources.\n- **Research:** The dataset can be used to study language patterns in mental health conversations or to develop new methods for AI-driven mental health support.\n\n#### Data Maintenance:\n- **Last Updated:** 2020\n- **Quality Control:** Regular checks will be performed to ensure the dataset maintains its high quality. Any new data added will go through the same rigorous cleaning and anonymization process.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- **Ethical Considerations:** Given the sensitive nature of mental health, users of this dataset should be mindful of ethical considerations, especially when deploying AI models trained on this data. Models should be designed to avoid providing harmful advice, and proper disclaimers should be included in any application.\n- **Community Contribution:** Users are encouraged to contribute to the dataset by providing feedback or additional data that can enhance its utility."}
